                            For our final, the purpose of our projects was to create an an artistic project using LED lights,
                            as well as everything we have learned about creative embedded systems, hardware, and software.
                          
                            <br><br>
                            I chose to create a project that would be personal to me--a music visualizer that I could hang on my wall
                            while I studied and listened to music in my dorm. 
                            <br><br>
      
                        </a>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <a>
                          
                          <h2>Hardware</h2>
                            From the hardware listed, as well as source code from processing, I was able to adapt a moving ball game 
                            to be responsive to input from a joystick and button.
                            By pressing on the  the joystick, you're able to change the velocity of the ball, which is represented on the code as the Z value.
                            
                            By moving the joystick, up or down, the user is able to change the direction of the ball. 
                            The input received in this case corresponds to the x or y axis as seen in the Arduino code. 
                            
                            The hardware is set up using wires and a breadboard setup as seen in the picture below.  (insert picture here)
                            It is powered by a USB-C cable which is connected to a laptop.

                            The majority of the wiring was covered up by an enclosing case I made. the inpiration of which was a game controller. 
                            It allowed me to keep the wires in place, as well as create a more user-friendly experience for a person testing the game.

                                The lights camed nested and fused together, but I was able to separate them using a sharp exacto knife 
                                and snapping them off (pictured later).

                            <h2>How to begin</h2>
                            The begin the LED musical ring, you run the python code. You may switch the playlist you're playing by going inside
                            the code and replacing the spotify playlist link. After running the code, watch the lights light up and enjoy.
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>How it works</h2>
                            The workflow of the project begins with the python file. Here, a playlist (hardcoded using a link, but can be replaced) is run. From
                            there, a random song is picked from the playlist using getTrack(), and information is extracted from that song. It then opens up spotify 
                            and begins playing that song.

                            I chose to get 'tempo', 'energy' and 'duration_ms' from the song. The first two were then sent to sendTrack(), which formatted the array data and
                            sent it over serial to the arduino using the corresponding port.

                            There is also a function called 'startTimer', which allows the code to run again after the song is done playing, and plays another song from the playlist
                            beginning the process all over again.

                            </figure>
                            <br><br>
                            From the Arduino, the information is received and parsed as an array of different types. I used sample code which I found online 
                            and it was really helpful in making sure I received the information. After getting this, the code runs a series of LED light pattern functions.
                            I started my code using sample code from the FastLED light library, in particular the sketch 'DemoReel100', which contained the RPM pattern. I modified this pattern,
                            as well as others, a lot to ensure that the song audio details were taken into account when creating a sync algorithm for my lights using 
                            the song that was playing. Once the song is over, the code goes back to the python side to begin the same process with a brand new song.
                            <br><br>

                            <h2>My process</h2>

                            My general workflow for this project followed and incremental coding style—this was to ensure that both my code, as well as my hardware were functioning.

                            The first thing I did was ensure that the lights were working by testing out some sample LED light code from the Freenove LED Arduino library.
                            From this, I was able to adjust the number of lights I lit up in rings which contained 241 LED lights in total.
                            <br><br>
                            After ensuring my hardware was good, I focused on getting started on the Spotify API, and pulling information from my account; in particular playlists. I used an API wrapper ‘Spotipy’ to create a faster connection without an access token. 
                            <br><br>
                            While building this code, I found it very helpful to reference the API’s documentation, specifically the documentation on playlist and song data.
                            Once I was able to create calls and pull songs from my playlist, I used random to shuffle a random song from the playlist. I ensured that I could extract data from the song that was pulled, I focused on the track’s name, tempo, duration_ms, and energy as defined by the documentation. I explain more on this latter on.
                            <br><br>
                            Once I was able to pull data from Spotify, the next step was to ensure I could send the proper data to serial on the Arduino side. This required a lot of tweaking as I was sending an array of <string, int, float> to Arduino, so I had to parse accordingly. I made much use of the serial monitor, as well as the TFT_eSPI() library to print variables not just on the serial, but on the LED screen of the esp32. This was immensely helpful, as I found that serial didn’t print some of my inputs, but the LED screen did which meant that data was indeed being received. Once I was done receiving information, I moved on to creating an algorithm using the tempo and energy levels of the song.
                            <br><br>
                            For the light algorithm itself, I based it much on preexisting patterns from the FastLED library. I adjusted much of the patterns to account for song variables, and added random intervals (such as ‘tempo oscillation’) so that I had a series of tempo switches and not just a flat tempo, which would inhibit the lights from showing more variety. I took in Professor’s suggestion that humans are unable to detect off-tempo for up to 40 BPM, which gave me a range to oscillatete my tempo to and from.
                            I did this because Spotify doesn’t provide a live song audio analysis, instead it averages the BPM of a song and provides an float name ‘tempo’ which I was using. I used the ‘energy’ level to adjust the hue of the lights, since light and liveliness are variables I associate together.

                            <h2>Difficulties and Takeaways</h2>
                            
                            There were many, many, many Difficulties. 
                            <br><br>
                            In terms of hardware issues, it was very challenging dealing with the ring-shaped LED lights.
                            Their manufacture was very flawed, and the wires came off very easily from their mount. While I sordered the ones that came off while
                            I was working, it was not enough to save them in the long run. The more I handled them (no matter how carefully), they came off their sorder and 
                            stopped lighting up. Getting the LED lights was perhaps the most difficult and time consuming part.
                            <br><br>
                            For the software, there were many challenges. First, dealing with the Spotify API was rather difficult since there is much data to parse through,
                            and there are different data types to account for. This becomes relevant when you begin sending data through serial to the arduino.
                            Another challenge was figuring out how to create an algorithm that would be interesting and would sync to the music. I found the FastLED
                            library to be very helpful in this case, in particular the 'DemoReel100' example sketch. One of the LED patterns in this file was 'BPM',
                            that I modified to oscillate within a given tempo of the song I was currently playing. I also modified some of the remaining patterns to be more
                            synced to the song playing.

                            That being said, the overall most difficult software part was ensuring that data was being recieved and formatted properly to be able to be received on the Arduino.
                            The following challenge was then to figure out a sync algorithm, but it became much easier taking in sample code and working from there.

                            <br><br>
                            In the future, I would suggest to use a better quality form of LED, as well as a better enclosure to ensure that wires aren't accidentally moved too much.
                            This would avoid small issues (like wires coming off from the LED), which ultimately turned into very difficult challenges.

                            I would also spend more time refining the tempo algorithm. Spotify API has much data about each song, and it would be amazing to see an algorithm
                            that takes in more than tempo and energy as variables to turn on the LED lights.
