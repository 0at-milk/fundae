                            For module 2, the purpose of our projects was to create an interactive 
                            devise using an ESP32, breadboard, joystick, and a button. Using Ardunio IDE, and Processing coding environments I
                            was able to connect the hardware to our visual environment (a computer screen) and begin coding.

                          <h2>How to play</h2>
                          Use the joystick to change the direction of the ball, or press the joystick or button to make the ball go faster.
                          Note that each time the ball is pushed away from the edge, the ball goes faster, thereby increasing the dificulty of the game.
                          <br><br>
                          <h2>Hardware</h2>
                            From the hardware listed, as well as source code from processing, I was able to adapt a moving ball game 
                            to be responsive to input from a joystick and button.
                            By pressing on the  the joystick, you're able to change the velocity of the ball, which is represented on the code as the Z value.
                            
                            By moving the joystick, up or down, the user is able to change the direction of the ball. 
                            The input received in this case corresponds to the x or y axis as seen in the Arduino code. 
                            
                            The hardware is set up using wires and a breadboard setup as seen in the picture below.  (insert picture here)
                            It is powered by a USB-C cable which is connected to a laptop.

                            The majority of the wiring was covered up by an enclosing case I made. the inpiration of which was a game controller. 
                            It allowed me to keep the wires in place, as well as create a more user-friendly experience for a person testing the game.
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>How does the code work?</h2>
                            We are using two coding environment: Arduino and Processing.

                            Arduino IDE allows us to load code into our ESP32. This is done by declaring pin numbers which will be  our input values from the joystick.

                            Processing, on the other hand, allows us to obtain the input information from the pins and do something with it.
                            As you can see on the code, we receive the values from the user's interaction with the joystick through the 'val' variable.

                            When the joystick is moved, the values are extracted from the variable and turned into an int[] array. this allows us to
                            adjust the xPos variable according to the new value of the x-axis value. This is also the case for the yPos value.

                            Since void draw() is executed consistently in a loop, each time the user moves the joystick the coordinate values of the ball will be adjusted,
                            thereby resulting in the ball moving according to the joystick movements.

                            The loop will only stop executing once the user has used all 5 of their 9 lives, by which the game will restart.

                            <br><br>

                            <h2>Difficulties and Takeaways</h2>
                            Perhaps one of the biggest challenges of this project was settign up the hardware and get it to work. The wires, as well as the breadboard,
                            proved very sensitive to any slight adjustemnets in both the code and in their phsycial positioning. In the future, it would be best if, once I found a
                            position on the breadboard that correctly received all the input from the corresponding pins, I keep the same layout as I continue working on the code 
                            and other functionalities. Taking pictures as references proved massively helpful as well.

                            I want to add also, that although a button was added to the code, it was very difficult to make it accessible to press given the orientation of my
                            breadboard as well as the type of wires used. 

                            I would also suggest workig in increments, such as working on the y-axis functionality, then hte x-axis, then so on. since
                            there is much data to be processed, it would be best to process only some data at once and make sure that it works before moving onto the next.
                            <br><br>
                            In the future, I would like to see the game be expanded to include a better scoring system, as well as more details to the UI. I also believe that the game could even be  
                            multiplayer using the ESP32 NOW protocol so that perhaps two players are coordinating their interactions and ensuring that they keep the game going as long as possible.
