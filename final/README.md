A series of LED lights that use spotify API to sink to a song's tempo and 'energy' levels.

Materials used: power source, arduino ESP32, ring LED lights, breadboard wires.

This work is free to be reproduced, replicate, or be edited. 

In order to test this code you may follow the documentation linked in this file, which contains images and a short walk-through. You may download this code, run the python and arduino code symultaneously. You must ensure that serial port is free when running the code for the first time to avoid errors.

The code was made possible by sample code from the Arduino FastLED library: sketch 'DemoReel100', as well as code from the following link. The latter was helpful in parsing through an array of different types in C++ to parse through the python information on the arduino side. I

I adjusted both codes for the purposes of my code listed on the documentatoon.

More code specifics can be explored by examining the functions on the python and/or arduino code.
