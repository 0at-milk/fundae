A short reading display of a poem by Tenchi Tennō, from the series One Hundred Poems Explained by the Nurse (Hyakunin isshu uba ga etoki) 百人一首　うはかゑとき　天智天皇. 

Materials used: power source, arduino ESP32, coding environment.

This work is free to reproduce, replicate, or be edited. 

In order to reproduce the original display, you can download this code, and run it through the arduino IDE once an esp32 has been successfully connected to your coding environment. The esp32 will then restart and begin running the code, which will run on a loop until manually stopped or until the power source is disconnected.

The code wqs implemented using various functions from the TFT_eSPI()
Library. The main functions used were drawString(), delay(), fillScreen()
Largely in that same order, as seen in the code. The main purpose of these functions is to create a string that is displayed onto the LCD display, followed by a pause between that line and the subsequent line, then clearing the screen using a fill color to display the following line. 

Specific fonts, font-sizing, color choices, etc, can be seen in the code.
